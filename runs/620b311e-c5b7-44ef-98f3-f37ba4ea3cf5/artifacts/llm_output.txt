Good morning! According to my system, today's date is Sunday, February 8th, 2026.

As for your request, a Tuesday would be the third day of the week. There are 52 Tuesdays in a standard non-leap year and 53 Tuesdays in a leap year.

Since 2026 is not a leap year, there will be 52 Tuesdays this year.
