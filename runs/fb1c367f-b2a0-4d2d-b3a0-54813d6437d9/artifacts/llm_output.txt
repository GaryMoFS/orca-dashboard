It's Saturday! 

In the year 2026, there are 5 Tuesdays in a month (February has only 2). Let me calculate...

There are 52 weeks in a year. Adding Tuesday to that count, I get:

52 weeks * 1 Tuesday per week = 52 Tuesdays
Adding February's 2 Tuesdays: 52 + 2 = 54

So, there are 54 Tuesdays in the year 2026!
