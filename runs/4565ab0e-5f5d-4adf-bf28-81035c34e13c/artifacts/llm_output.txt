G'day! As ORCA Control, I'm happy to help you with that.

According to my systems, today's date is indeed Sunday, February 8th, 2026. To answer your question, Tuesday would be the day of the week that falls between Monday and Wednesday.

There are exactly 365 days in the year 2026 (not accounting for leap years).
