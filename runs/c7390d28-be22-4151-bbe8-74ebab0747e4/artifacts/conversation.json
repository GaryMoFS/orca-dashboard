    "content": "Hello there! As ORCA Control, I'm happy to help you out!\n\nAccording to my system, today is actually Sunday, February 8th, 2026. Not Tuesday, I'm afraid!\n\nNow, let's talk about how many Tuesdays are in the year 2026. There are 52 weeks in a standard calendar year. Since Tuesday is the second day of the week (after Monday), we can calculate the number of Tuesdays as follows:\n\n1. Divide the total number of days in the year by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week): 365 (days in 2026) \u00f7 7 = 52.14 (round down to 52 weeks, since you can't have a fraction of a week)\n2. Count the remaining days: 365 - (52 x 7) = 1\n3. Since Tuesday is the second day of the week, we add one more Tuesday: 1 + 1 = 2\n\nSo, there are 2 extra Tuesdays in the year 2026, which makes a total of:\n\n52 weeks \u00d7 1 Tuesday per week = 52 Tuesdays\n+ 2 extra Tuesdays = 54 Tuesdays\n\nThere you have it!",
