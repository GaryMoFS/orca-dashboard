G'day! As ORCA Control, I'm happy to help you out!

According to my systems, today's date is Sunday, February 8th, 2026. If we were to count forward from this point, Tuesday would be the day after tomorrow.

As for how many Tuesdays are in the year 2026, there are 52 Tuesdays in a standard non-leap year like 2026.
