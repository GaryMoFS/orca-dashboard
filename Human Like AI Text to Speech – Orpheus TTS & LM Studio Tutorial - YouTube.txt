(00:07) hello everyone and welcome back to the channel today we're revisiting the exciting world of text to speech generation with a look at the groundbreaking Orphus TTS model recently released by canopy AI this open- Source speech language model is truly impressive capable of generating incredibly natural and expressive humanlike speech that Rivals even the best closed Source options out there orfus stands out with its ability to convey emotion control intonation and even perform zero shot voice cloning all while being incredibly fast here let's
(00:40) take a quick listen to some demo examples hey there guys it's Terra here and uh let me introduce you to Zach who seems to be asleep Zach it's time to wakey wakey H I was having such a great dream why are you bothering me what time is it Anyway classic Zach always so gry well it's time to introduce orus to the world orus is a speech language model that sounds like an actual person you know like a living breathing person being released under the Apache 2 license means it's freely available for you to use modify and explore for both
(01:22) personal and Commercial projects which is fantastic for the open source Community to make this powerful model even more accessible I want to introduce you to a fantastic open source project called Orphus fast API web UI this project provides a sleek and user-friendly web interface built with fast API that allows you to easily run orus TTS it's packed with features like an open AI compatible API a modern web UI with waveform visualization and support for multiple voices and emotion tags to really bring your text to life
(01:53) what's even better is that it's optimized for performance especially on RTX gpus now to make things even easier for you I've created a fork of this project that comes with built-in support for LM studio right out of the box this version also extends the context window to massive 8192 tokens and utilizes the ggf model format meaning it's less demanding on your systems resources and can even run smoothly on gpus with less than 4GB of vram in this video I'm going to guide you step by step through the process of
(02:27) installing this Amazing Project locally on your own machine so you can start experimenting with orus TTS right away now if you're looking for a super quick and easy way to get up and running without the manual installation process I've got you covered over on my patreon page I've created a one-click Windows installer for this orfus fast API project this installer handles all the dependencies and setup for you and includes handy startup files to simplify managing and launching the project plus by becoming a patron you'll gain
(03:02) access to a whole library of exclusive content including custom AI workflows one-click installers for other awesome open- Source AI tools like kyui for image generation Laura training resources voice cloning guides and even cab resources it's a great way to support the channel and get access to even more AI goodies so stick around and let's jump into setting up orus TTS fast API on your local system don't forget to smash that subscribe button and ring the bell so you don't miss out on more awesome AI content okay let's move on to getting
(03:34) orus TTS fast API web UI up and running on your local machine now if you're a patreon member and opted for the one-click installer the process is incredibly straightforward first things first you'll need to make sure you have LM Studio installed just head over to the LM Studio website and download the version compatible with your operating system whether you're on Windows Mac or Linux the installation is just a few clicks once LM Studio is installed patreon members can simply download the orfus TTS LM Studio Windows batch file
(04:06) from my patreon post and doubleclick it to kick off the installation this batch file will automatically install my forked version of the orfus TTS fast API this special version comes preconfigured to work seamlessly with the LM Studio API has that extended 8192 contact window we talked about and takes care of installing all the necessary software bits and pieces or dependencies for you after the installer finishes you'll find a quick start file in the project directory just use that to launch the web UI now let's get the Orphus model into
(04:46) LM Studio open up LM studio and go to the Discover tab in the search bar type Orphus and you should see the Orphus 3B 4K mgg UF model pop up go ahead and download that one it's quite Compact and from my testing it runs smoothly even on systems with as little as 4GB of vram once the download is complete switch over to the developer tab in LM Studio here you'll load in the orus model you just downloaded loading the model will automatically start up the LM Studio API server in the background and it'll be ready to communicate with our web UI
(05:27) right away now for those of you who are going the manual installation path don't worry it's still quite manageable to keep things clean and avoid any software conflicts we're going to use miniconda miniconda is a package manager that creates isolated environments for your projects so everything stays organized just Google miniconda and go to the Anaconda website download the miniconda installer for your operating system and run through the installation process once minondo is installed we need to open up the Anaconda prompt just
(06:01) type Anaconda prompt into your windows search bar and click to open it in the Anaconda prompt we're going to create a dedicated environment for our Orphus TTS project type this command exactly cond create DN or sdts python equal 310- y it's important to use Python 3.1 for this environment as other versions might cause issues with the software dependencies after the environment is created activate it by typing cond to activate Orphus DTS you'll see the name of the environment Orphus DTS appear at the beginning of your command prompt letting
(06:42) you know you're in the correct environment now let's navigate to the folder where you want to install the project files use the CD command followed by the path to your desired folder for example if you created a new folder called orus projects you would type CD orus projects make sure you also have get installed on your system it allows us to easily download projects from GitHub if you don't have it just Google git download click on the link from the git SCM website and download and install git for your operating
(07:14) system with Git installed we're ready to clone the orus fast API webui repository head over to the orus fast API LM Studio GitHub repository I'll put a link in the description below for you copy the repository link from the GitHub page back in your anaconda prompt type get clone and then paste the repository link you just copied and press enter this will download the project files to your chosen directory once the cloning is done navigate into the newly created project folder by typing CD orus fast apil LM Studio next let's install Pi torch with
(07:52) Cuda support for GPU acceleration you can copy this command directly from the repository and run it inside your terminal if you're using Windows don't forget to remove the three from the PIP command as this is mainly used for Linux and Mac finally to install all the necessary software packages run the command pip install our requirements.
(08:21) txt this will install all the dependencies needed to run the project within our isolated cond environment after everything is installed to start the fast API server simply type Python app.py and press enter once the server is running open your web browser and go to the address 127.0.0.1 1555 this should take you directly to the orus fast API web UI from this point on whether you use the one-click installer or the manual method the process is the same you'll need to have LM Studio running with the orfus 3B 4km GG UF model loaded
(09:07) and the API server started just like we covered earlier once that's set up you can come back to the orus fast API web UI and start generating audio using the web UI is really straightforward just type in the text you want to convert to speech in the text box you can use those emotion tags we talked about earlier like laugh or side to add extra expressiveness to the generated voice you can also select from the eight different voices available in the project if you click the advanced options button you'll find a slider to
(09:40) adjust the speech speed once you're happy with your settings click generate speech on my RTX 4056 GB card it usually takes less than a minute to generate audio though longer text will take a bit longer of course it's a little slower than some other open source teach TS options like kakuro TTS which I covered in a video about a month ago but the quality in my opinion is noticeably more realistic don't just take my word for it though have a listen to this example you won't believe what just happened it was the funniest thing ever
(10:22) I literally almost forgot to subscribe to the local lab channel so whether you chose the quick oneclick route or went through the man manual installation you now have the powerful orus TTS model running locally on your machine with a user-friendly web interface experiment with the different voices emotion tags and settings to really explore the capabilities of this amazing open- Source textto speech model thanks for watching and don't forget to like And subscribe for more AI tutorials and open source project spotlights
