# ORCA Platform — Investor Demo Narrative (WIP)

## Vision

A unified AI platform for the built world:

- Design
- Compliance
- Construction
- Lifecycle management

Powered by:

- ORCA runtime
- FSPU computation
- F-Stack trust layer

---

## Phase 1 — AI Infrastructure

Local-first AI stack:

- Chat
- Text-to-speech
- Model orchestration

Goal:
Stable, private AI workspace.

---

## Phase 2 — Design Automation

TXT → IFC pipeline.

Impact:

- Rapid concept modeling
- Faster approvals
- Reduced design friction

---

## Phase 3 — Spatial Intelligence

Sketch → IFC → VR.

Impact:

- Real-time design exploration
- Client engagement
- Reduced iteration cycles

---

## Phase 4 — Compliance Intelligence

NCC/BCA + Standards integration.

Impact:

- Faster approvals
- Reduced regulatory risk
- Automated documentation

---

## Phase 5 — Trust Infrastructure

FSPU + F-Stack:

- Provenance
- Ownership
- Auditability

Impact:

Industry-scale digital trust.

---

## Long-Term Vision

A game-like platform where:

- Designers
- Engineers
- Regulators
- Builders

collaborate in one AI-native environment.

## Current Status

M1 — Runtime Stabilisation  
M2 — TXT → IFC  
M3 — Sketch → IFC VR  
M4 — GPU Orchestration  
M5 — FSPU/F-Stack  
M6 — NCC Integration  
M7 — Standards Integration
M8 — Persona Runtime
M8.5 — Schema Hardening (PASS)
M9 — Persona Marketplace (PASS)
M10 — Creator Workflow (Step 1 PASS)
M11 — Director Control Plane (PASS)

---

## Key Differentiator

AI + Geometry + Compliance + Trust in one stack.

No competitor currently delivers all four.

---

## Investment Opportunity

Seed phase:

- Platform completion
- Industry pilot
- Strategic partnerships

---

## Milestone Verification Status

Date/time: 2026-02-10 16:25

- M3 (Sketch->VR): PASS - Builder integrated, VR app skeleton ready.
- M4 (GPU Orch): PASS - Tier detection and lifecycle logic verified.
- M5 (F-Stack): PASS - Manifest signing and audit logging functional.
- M6 (Compliance): PASS - NCC rules engine operational with demo data.
- M7 (Standards): PASS - Adapter layer extracts constraints successfully.
- Run Contract: PASS - Skill installed, ledger initialized, and workflow verified.
- M8 (Personas): PASS - Customizable overlays, capability gating, API endpoints, and Dashboard UI verified.
- M11 (Director): PASS - Production oversight console and session orchestration functional.
- Director has live flight recorder + console.
- Users can upload sketches/screenshots with auto-OCR and instant platform ingestion.
- The Quest Engine loop is fully playable: transition from field observation (Inbox) to engineering task (Quest) is live.
- Platform integrity is maintained via automated Doc Discipline (Q4), ensuring documentation and schemas never drift from the code.
- M12 Capability Trails provides a live, auditable catalog of all platform pipelines, from Design-to-IFC to OpenCNC fabrication logic.
- M13 Progress Dashboard integrates Milestones, Quests, and live Hotfixes into a high-fidelity command center for project governance.
- M14 cap.txt_to_ifc v0 demo is live, producing valid IFC4 BIM models from textual room specifications with full audit trails.
- M15 Action Bridge enables one-click parameterized BIM generation directly from the Director Console with automated governance receipts.
